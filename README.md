It includes additional data mined from Department of Marine Resources (ME) and Dr. RObert Steneck's long term surveys
Plus a few years of Walter ADey (Smithsonian) algal biomass sampling

>>FILE DESCRIPTION>>
    #github_sg.R
        CURRENT Rscript I need help with.  Here I am trying to build the kelp-temperature-urchin model (with periodic success and frquent failures)
    #manuscript_seaweedRoyalB_edit.R
        larger Rscript which includes all figures for DRAFT version of manuscript to Royal Academy B
    #dmr.csv
        data file from DMR-ME urchin/kelp surveys
    #gom_combined.csv
        temperature data from NOAA/Neracoos buoys combined into one master file.
    #stenecksg.csv
        algal/urchin surveys conducted by Steneck, Adey, Rasher and Suskiewicz (various years)
    #algal_biomass.csv
        total algal biomass in quadrats to individual speceis or functional group

 >>MEMO TO JARRETT
    Review "github_sg.R" script.  Here's where I need to get un-stuck.  I deleted a bunch of my failed attempts to generate a model but left my comments towards the end.

Also, environmental data (mostly water temperature) from NOAA buoys downloaded and stiched together, with mild EC

Comments herein are largely from TSS (suskiewicz.thew@gmail.com) with input from DBR and JEB.

Thanks for all the kelp!
