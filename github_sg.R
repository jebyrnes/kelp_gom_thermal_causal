## Notes on Data set(s)
##
## These analyses require merging several datasets collected by different groups for different purposes
## Datasets Used:
##      dmr.csv - Annual random surveys of kelp and urchin cover by DMR from 2001 thru 2019.  Kelp is % cover. urchins are count
##      stenecksg.csv  - Fleshy macroalgae surveys (in % cover) by Bob Steneck (1997-present) & Doug Rasher (2016-present)
##      gom_combined.csv  - Water Temperature derived from NOAA & NERACOOS ocean buoys (2001-present)

#working model is: Kelp%Cover ~GMC Degree Days * GMC Urchin Threshold + 1|Region + 1|Year
#where GMC = Group Mean Centering

##   Here (below) we are taking the logit-transformation of kelp and TEMPERATURE in order to 
##    ARG>>>> NEED TO GET THIS WORKED OUT>  I THINK IT IS TEMP KELP GMC, BUT KELP IS LOGIT TRANSFERED TO ACCOUNT FOR DISTRIBUTION 
##  Kelp is logit transformed.  This creates a more linear distrbution, rather than clumps at the low end and high end.
## asked for guidance... DBR deferred to JEB, waiting response
## Model (conceptuatlly) is: the effect of temperature degree days (GMC) and urchin abundance (GMC) on kelp cover (logit trasnformed) 
##... with year and region as random variables

#Success??!!

#Run Model####

#working model: Kelp%Cover ~GMC Degree Days * GMC Urchin Threshold + 1|Region + 1|Year
#syntax is much different for gllvm package though.


              

##BELOW are notes and musings.  Largely where I'm getting stuck.

# MODEL GENERATION ####
# if I use the gllvm and compare via anova, my syntax should look like this:
# y =  ... a datafram
# x =  ... a dataframe
# TR = ... a dataframe
# gllvm(y, X, TR, formula = ~ Kelp Percent  + TempStress + Urchin Abundance )



#what are we trying to measure here...?   "Is Kelp Percent Cover by region a function of Temperature and Urchin Abundance?"  
    

#y in example = abundance data; kelp abundance
#X in exmaple = enviornmental data; temperature data
#TR in example = traits of ants.  





##NEXT: Before generating model, need better kelp data transformation, as kelp cover is highly non-linear and bound between 0 and 100.
# Beta regression a may improve for porportional data such as this 
#see Douma & Weedon (2019) in Methods Ecol Evol.
#use glmmTMB package for beta-regression transformation



\##Additional problems:  Which gllvm syntax to use for question being asked.
## how to make 'region' and 'year' random factors ('1|year' does not work within package) - STILL A PROBLEM (post JEB conversation)
